# Archived Final Project for .NET Course


This project is a collabrative effort with a fellow classmate as a final project for my ASP.Net course.
I took care of the Purchasing Section of this Website. I hope you have fun looking at what I have done,
and I hope you have a great day.

This application was done in December 2016. I and a friend of mine have teamed for this final project in order
to create an application.

Sincerely,

Leban Mohamed
